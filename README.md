# Alchemint

This is the start of a cashu mint. 

DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION!

The key generation is FLAWED! We should use Bip32, but now is just
random bytes for each private key.

DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION! (yet)

KEYS ARE STORED IN THE DB WITHOUT ENCRYPTION!
SO PLEASE REFRAIN FROM USING THIS IN PRODUCTION!
